Welcome to **cosmology**, a Python module implementing a gradient-flow optimizer for cosmological parameters within the **Sentience-Field Hypothesis (SFH)** Protocol 3. This tool supports SFH's cosmological application (Section 5.1 of *The Sentience-Field Hypothesis: Consciousness as the Fabric of Reality* by Mark Rowe Traver, IngramSpark, 2025, ISBN: 978-0-123456-78-9), optimizing qualic energy distributions (\(Q\)) to match observed cosmological data.

## Overview

The optimizer minimizes the loss function \(L(\theta) = \|f(\theta) - d_{\text{obs}}\|^2 + \lambda R(\theta)\) (Equation 10), where \(f(\theta)\) is a forward model approximating qualic field dynamics, and \(R(\theta)\) is a regularized prior term. This aligns with SFH's optimization functional \(\dot{\Phi}(t) = -\nabla_q J(q) + \xi(t)\) (Equation 4), facilitating empirical validation of qualic coherence and fertility in the cosmos. The module includes a simplified linear surrogate model, with plans for physics-based enhancements.

## Installation

To install the `cosmology` module, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/urmt/SFH_Python_CODE.git
   cd SFH_Python_CODE/SFH_JCS_Article/Sentient-Field_Tools/cosmology

Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have Python 3.11 and the required packages:
bashpip install numpy pandas matplotlib autograd

Install the Module:
Install locally for use in your projects:
bashpip install .


Usage
Basic Example
The following example tunes cosmological parameters for synthetic observations, aligned with SFH Protocol 3:
pythonimport pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from cosmology import run_cosmo_tuning

# Generate synthetic cosmological data
np.random.seed(42)
obs_data = pd.DataFrame(np.random.normal(0.3, 0.1, 3))  # e.g., Ω_m, H0, Ω_Λ
obs_data.to_csv('data/obs_data.csv', index=False)

# Run optimization
result = run_cosmo_tuning('data/obs_data.csv', lambda_reg=0.01, lr=1e-3, n_iter=2000)
print("Optimization Result:", result)
Key Functions

run_cosmo_tuning(obs_file, lambda_reg=0.01, lr=1e-3, n_iter=5000, seed=None):

Returns a dictionary with 'theta' (final parameters), 'loss_history' (list of losses), and 'converged' (bool).
